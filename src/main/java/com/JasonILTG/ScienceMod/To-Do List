To-Do List

Perpetual:
	Generalize as much as possible
	Create more functionality
	Edit code for more readability by adding comments and standardizing formatting

Miscellaneous
	Clean up code for messages

Finish Machines (Mostly GUI Stuff):
	Work on Centrifuge, Filter, and Distiller
	Fix Fluid Tank GUI Initialization
	Block Texture
	Sided Inventory
	Redstone Trigger
	Settings

Add more uses for elements and compounds:
	Add compounds
		Fuel, etc.
	Add dusts and recipes for them
	Add metal ingots and crafting uses for them
	Add ores and ore generation
	Add things to ore dictionary

Add solutions and mixtures
	Add more precipitate dissolving and forming recipes

Add more machines
	Chemical reactor that has inputs, jars, catalysts, and outputs
	Distiller to turn solutions into mixtures
	Work on mixer
	Centrifuge to separate precipitates

Add electricity and heat energy systems
	Electricity
		Units: TBD
		Wires to transfer electricity, with different efficiencies for different materials
		Storage
			Different kinds of batteries
			Different kinds of storage blocks
		Generators (fuel, solar, wind, hydroelectric, thermal, fission, fusion, etc.)
	Heat and Temperature
		Add NBT values for machines with heat, specific heat, and temperature
		Add heat conduits that conduct heat between machines
		Add a thermometer that either reads the temperature of a machine
		or gives the ambient temperature, which is calculated by the temperature
		of nearby machines
		Heat generators turn heat into electricity
		Chemical reactors can use heat as energy

Add more miscellaneous science stuff
	Magnets
	Measuring Devices
