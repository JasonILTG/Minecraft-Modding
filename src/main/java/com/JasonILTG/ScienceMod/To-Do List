To-Do List

Perpetual:
	Generalize as much as possible
	Create more functionality
	Edit code for more readability by adding comments and standardizing formatting

Finish Machines (Mostly GUI Stuff)
	Progress Bar and Fluid Tank Animation
	Block Texture
	Sided Inventory
	Redstone Trigger

Add more uses for elements and compounds:
	Add state of matter NBT tag
	Add compounds
		Fuel, etc.
	Add dusts and recipes for them
	Add metal ingots and crafting uses for them
	Add ores and ore generation
	Add things to ore dictionary

Add solutions and mixtures
	NBT tags with ions dissolved/substances mixed
	Add functionality to  solutions to make precipitate NBT tags out of
	compatible ion NBT tags

Add more machines
	Chemical reactor that has inputs, jars, catalysts, and outputs
	Distiller to turn solutions into mixtures
	Mixer to create mixtures and solutions
	Centrifuge to separate precipitates
	Condenser to extract water from the air

Add electricity and heat energy systems
	Electricity
		Units: TBD
		Wires to transfer electricity, with different efficiencies for different materials
		Storage
			Different kinds of batteries
			Different kinds of storage blocks
		Generators (fuel, solar, wind, hydroelectric, thermal, fission, fusion, etc.)
	Heat and Temperature
		Add NBT values for machines with heat, specific heat, and temperature
		Add heat conduits that conduct heat between machines
		Add a thermometer that either reads the temperature of a machine
		or gives the ambient temperature, which is calculated by the temperature
		of nearby machines
		Heat generators turn heat into electricity
		Chemical reactors can use heat as energy

Add more miscellaneous science stuff
	Magnets
	Measuring Devices
